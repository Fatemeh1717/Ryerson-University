Preparation:
The dataset is related to white Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. For more info:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality
Import the following file:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/winequality/winequality-white.csv

### 1.Check the datatypes of the attributes. (3 points)

```{r}

Wine_Database <- read.csv2(file ="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv", header = T, sep = ";")

```


```{r}
head(Wine_Database)
str(Wine_Database)


Wine_Database[,1:11] <- sapply(Wine_Database[,1:11], as.numeric)
str(Wine_Database)
```
### 2.Are there any missing values in the dataset? (4 points)

```{r}
sum(is.na(Wine_Database))

# There is not any missing value in the dataset.

```
### 3.What is the correlation between the attributes other than Quality? (10 points)

```{r}
Wines_Vari_Corrolation <- Wine_Database[-12]
cor(Wines_Vari_Corrolation)

```
```{r}
library("PerformanceAnalytics")

chart.Correlation(Wines_Vari_Corrolation , histogram = TRUE)
```

### 4.Graph the frequency distribution of wine quality by using Quality. (10 points)

```{r}
hist(Wine_Database$quality, main = "Wine Quality", xlab = "Score", col = "LightBlue")

```

### 5.Reduce the levels of rating for quality to two levels as Pass and Fail.Assign the levels of 3, 4 and 5 to level Fail; and 6, 7, 8 and 9 to level Pass.(10 points)

```{r}
Wine_Database$quality <- ifelse(Wine_Database$quality<6 ,"Fail", "Pass")

```


```{r}
head(Wine_Database$quality ,13)
```

```{r}

round(prop.table(table(Wine_Database$quality)) * 100, digits = 1)

```
### 6.Normalize the data set. (12 points)

```{r}
Normalized_Function <- function(x){
  return(x-min(x))/(max(x)-min(x))
}
Normalized_Wine_Dataset <- as.data.frame(sapply(Wine_Database[-12], Normalized_Function))

head(Normalized_Wine_Dataset)

```
### 7.Divide the dataset to training and test sets.(12points)

```{r}


Wine_index <- sample(1:nrow(Normalized_Wine_Dataset), 0.7*nrow(Normalized_Wine_Dataset))
Wine_train_set <- Normalized_Wine_Dataset[Wine_index,]
Wine_test_set <- Normalized_Wine_Dataset[-Wine_index,]

Wine_train_set_Labels <- Wine_Database[Wine_index,12]
head(Wine_train_set_Labels)
Wine_train_set_Labels <-as.integer(as.character(Wine_train_set_Labels)=="Pass")
head(Wine_train_set_Labels)

Wine_test_set_Labels <- Wine_Database[-Wine_index,12]
head(Wine_test_set_Labels)
Wine_test_set_Labels<-as.integer(as.character(Wine_test_set_Labels)=="Pass")
head(Wine_test_set_Labels)

head(Wine_train_set)
head(Wine_test_set)




```
### 8.Use the Logistic Regression algorithm to predict the quality of wine using its attributes. (12 points)


```{r}

Wine_GLM_Train_Model <- glm(Wine_train_set_Labels~., Wine_train_set , family = "binomial")
summary(Wine_GLM_Train_Model)

```

```{r}


Wine_Predict_Set<-predict(Wine_GLM_Train_Model,Wine_test_set, type = "response")
head(Wine_Predict_Set)

```

### 9.Display the confusion matrix to evaluate the model performance. (12 points)


```{r}
# I  have set the threshold to 0.5. All probability equal or higher to 0.5 will be classified as above average and all probability less than 0.5 will be classified as below average restaurant.

Wine_Predict_Class <- ifelse(Wine_Predict_Set >=0.5 ,1,0)
head(Wine_Predict_Class)

Wine_ConfusionMatrix <- table(Actual=Wine_test_set_Labels, Predicted = Wine_Predict_Class)

Wine_ConfusionMatrix


```


### 10.Evaluate the model performance by computing Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity. (15 points)

```{r}

# I Evaluated the model by using two approach: 1- using a confusionMatrix Comment directly from caret library
library(caret)
#install.packages('e1071', dependencies=TRUE)

confusionMatrix(Wine_ConfusionMatrix)

```


```{r}
# The Second approach would be  Calculating the performance manually:

# Accuracy= TP + TN/TP + FN + FP + TN

Wine_Predic_Accuracy <-sum(diag(Wine_ConfusionMatrix))/nrow(Wine_test_set)
cat("Accuracy: ",Wine_Predic_Accuracy)

#Sensitivity = Tp/TP+FN
# Here Sensitivity is equal to "Pos Pred Value"obtained from confusionMatrix Comment.
Wine_Predict_Sensitivity <-Wine_ConfusionMatrix[1,1]/(Wine_ConfusionMatrix[1,1]+Wine_ConfusionMatrix[1,2])
cat("Sensitivity: ",Wine_Predict_Sensitivity)

#Specifity = TN /TN+FP
#Here Specifity is equal to "Neg Pred Value" obtained from confusionMatrix Comment.
Wine_Predict_Specifity <- Wine_ConfusionMatrix[2,2]/(Wine_ConfusionMatrix[2,2]+Wine_ConfusionMatrix[2,1])
cat("Specifity: ",Wine_Predict_Specifity )

```
