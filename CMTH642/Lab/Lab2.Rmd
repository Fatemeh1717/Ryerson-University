### 1-A bottle filling machine is set to fill bottles with soft drink to a volume of 500 ml. The
actual volume is known to follow a normal distribution. The manufacturer believes the
machine is under-filling bottles. A sample of 20 bottles is taken and the volume of liquid
inside is measured.
The volumes were: 484.11, 459.49, 471.38, 512.01, 494.48, 528.63, 493.64, 485.03, 473.88,
501.59, 502.85, 538.08, 465.68, 495.03, 475.32, 529.41, 518.13, 464.32, 449.08, 489.27
(a) Calculate the sample mean and standard deviation.
(b) Use a one-sample t-test to determine whether the bottles are being consistently
under filled using a significance level of 0.01.

H0: mean(bottel_samle) = mu (population sample:500 ml)
HA: mean(bottle_sample) < mu (population sample:500 ml)

if p-value < 0.01 --> reject
if p-value >0.01 --> not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis


```{r}
bottels <-c(484.11, 459.49, 471.38, 512.01, 494.48, 528.63,
493.64, 485.03, 473.88, 501.59, 502.85, 538.08, 465.68, 495.03,
475.32, 529.41, 518.13, 464.32, 449.08, 489.27)

mean(bottels)
sd(bottels)

t.test(bottels , mu=500 , alternative = "less" , conf.level = 0.99)

```
Because the p-value is greater than 0.01 so we do not enogh evidence to rejecet the null hypothesis

### 2-An outbreak of Salmonella-related illness was attributed to ice cream produced at a certain factory. Scientists measured the level of Salmonella in 9 randomly sampled batches
of ice cream.
The levels (in MPN/g) were: 0.593 0.142 0.329 0.691 0.231 0.7930.5190.392 0.418
Assuming that the data follows the normal distribution, is there evidence that the mean
level of Salmonella in the ice cream is greater than 0.3 MPN/g?

H0: mean(x)== mean(population sample=0.3)
Ha: mean(x)> mean(population sample=0.3)

```{r}
x = c(0.593,0.142,0.329,0.691,0.231,0.793,0.519,0.392,0.418)

t.test(x, alternative = "greater", mu=0.3)


```
Because the p-value 0.02 is less then 0.05 we can reject the null hypothesis

### 3-Load the MASS package. The immer dataset of the MASS library have yields from
a barley field trial. Y1 attribute represents yields in 1931 and Y2 attribute represents
yields in 1932. Assuming that the data follows the normal distribution, find the 95%
confidence interval estimate of the difference between the mean barley yields of 1931 and
1932.

```{r}
install.packages("MASS")
library(MASS)


```


```{r}
t.test(immer$Y1 , immer$Y2 , paired = TRUE)
```

### 4-Assuming that the data in mtcars follows the normal distribution, find the 95% confidence interval estimate of the difference between the mean gas mileage of manual and automatic transmissions


```{r}
data("mtcars")
str(mtcars)

automatic = mtcars$am == 0

mpg.auto = mtcars[automatic, ]$mpg
mpg.auto

mpg.manual <- mtcars[!automatic,]$mpg
mpg.manual

t.test(mpg.auto, mpg.manual)
```
