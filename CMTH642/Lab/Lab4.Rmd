When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


### 1- Read the data set mtcars in R. It gives a comparison between different car models in terms of
mileage per gallon mpg, cylinder displacement disp, horse power , weight of the car wt and some more parameters.
1. Create a subset of the variables mpg, disp, hp and wt from the mtcars data. Construct the scatter plot for these attributes.

```{r}
attach(mtcars)
subset_mtcars <- mtcars[,c("mpg","disp","hp","wt")]

head(subset_mtcars)
plot(subset_mtcars)

```

### 2-In multiple linear regression, the null hypothesis is that all of the coefficients of the
variables are equal to zero against the alternative that allows them to take any values.
Ho: β1 = β2 = β3::: = βn = 0
If we reject this null hypothesis, then there is enough evidence to conclude that at least
one of the variables has predictive power in our linear model.
Fit a multiple linear regression model with mpg as the response variable and disp and
hp as the input variables. Check the p-values to evaluate the significance of the input
variables.

```{r}
summary(lm(mpg~ disp+hp, data = mtcars))

```
Since the t-test value of disp variable is -4.098 with p-value 0.000306 which is less than
0.05, we can conclude that the coefficient of disp is not zero.
Similarly, the t-test value of hp variable is -1.856 with p-value 0.073679 which is more
than 0.05, we cannot reject the null hypothesis for hp.

### 3- Create two multiple linear regression models having both mpg as output, and disp+hp
and disp+hp+wt as input variables respectively. Discuss the significance of these two
models by running ANOVA which compares residuals.

```{r}
reduced <- lm(mpg~ disp + hp , data = mtcars)
summary(reduced)

full <- lm(mpg~ disp + hp + wt , data = mtcars)
summary(full)


# Apply Anova to both models

anova(reduced, full)


```
The output shows the results of ANOVA. Here, the null hypothesis is that, given the
coefficient values of disp and hp, the coefficient of wt is zero. Since F=12.709 with pvalue 0.001331, we reject the null hypothesis. We can conclude that the wt is contributing
significantly to predict mpg.
Furthermore, by checking the Adjusted R-squared of the two models, we can say that
the full model with disp+hp+wt as input variables has more predictive value than the
reduced model with disp+hp as input variables
